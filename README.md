PLEASE MAKE SURE YOUR INTERNET IS WORKING WHILE YOU WORK WITH THIS PROJECT.

For running this project you have to download this repository on your system.
Secondly you should have downloaded the xampp which helps you keep up with apache and php mysql.
after download and setup of xampp you need to run the xampp for creating you device a live server where you can host
you PHP website (as php is server side scripting language it need server)
when you will run xampp it will generate a folder named (lampp) in your device just open that folder and find 
a folder called htdocs just copy the project folder there.
lampp->htdocs->(copy the project folder)

After the steup you need to setup your database.
you have file name (subscribers.sql) inside the project folder (the repo you downloaded).
Go to the phpmyadmin in your browser when it open you need to create new table with name of subscribers you should
check if there is any other table name before like this in your database. (if there you need to change the name ).
Find the option of import in top navigation click on that and drag the subscriber.sql file and it will import the database i created.
There should be no password of database. 



After the setup you can go in your browser and run this Link  http://localhost:8080/magetest/classes/index.php
